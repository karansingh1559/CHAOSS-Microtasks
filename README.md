## SCRIPT INDEX
* [MICROTASK1](https://github.com/karansingh1559/CHAOSS-Microtasks/blob/master/Microtask1/mt1.py)

  Produce a Python script that produces configuration files for Mordred to analyze a complete GitHub organization, excluding repositories that are forks from other GitHub repositories. Test it with at least two GitHub organizations, producing screenshots of the resulting dashboard.
* [MICROTASK2](https://github.com/karansingh1559/CHAOSS-Microtasks/blob/master/Microtask2/mt2.py)

  Produce a Python script that adds a new GitHub repository (git and GitHub issues / pull requests) to a given set of Mordred configuration files. Test it by adding at least two repositories (in two separate steps) to a GrimoireLab dashboard, producing screenshots of the results.

* [MICROTASK3](https://github.com/karansingh1559/CHAOSS-Microtasks/blob/master/Microtask3/mt3.py)(INCOMPLETE)

  Produce a Python script that removes a GitHub repository (git and GitHub issues / pull requests) from a working GrimoireLab dashboard, by modifying the needed Mordred configuration files, and fixing the raw and enriched indexes to remove the items for the removed repository. Test it by removing at least two repositories (in two separate steps) from a GrimoireLab dashboard, producing screenshots of the results.

* [MICROTASK4](https://github.com/karansingh1559/CHAOSS-Microtasks/blob/master/Microtask4/mt4.py)(INCOMPLETE)

  Perform any other modification of Mordred configuration files that you may find useful, showing screenshots of how that affects the resulting dashboard.
  
* [MICROTASK5](https://github.com/karansingh1559/CHAOSS-Microtasks/blob/master/Microtask5/README.md)

  Produce a pull request for any of the GrimoireLab tools, and try to follow instructions until it gets accepted. Try do do something simple that you consider useful, not necessarily fix to the code: improvement of comments, documentation or testing will usually be easier to get accepted, and very useful for the project. Please, avoid just producing a random pull request just to have another microtask: the objective is not that you get one more microtask done, but that you understand how to interact with developers in the project contributing with something that could be useful).
