I made a couple of PR's:
* [#21](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/21)
* [#23](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/23)

and also raised a couple of Issues:
* [#18](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/issues/18)
* [#138](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat/issues/138)

I couldn't work as much as I wanted to because of my ongoing college semester exams.
I'll be a lot more active as soon as my exams get over :D
